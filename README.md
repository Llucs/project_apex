Galaxy AI is here - Bring S-series Galaxy AI and smart One UI optimizations to supported Samsung devices — safely and reversibly.

---

### *Overview*

Project Apex is a Magisk module inspired by Aionix that adds advanced Galaxy AI from high-end S-series devices and performs advanced optimizations specifically for One UI, the same optimizations as [OneUI Enhancer](https://github.com/Llucs/oneui_enhancer)

Project Apex doesn't perform aggressive optimizations; it performs stable and reversible optimizations that improve your phone's fluidity without compromising stability

The module applies controlled device property overrides to unlock selected S-series features and Galaxy Store availability.

---

### *Compatibility*

Project Apex is compatible with Samsung devices running One UI 7, but may not function perfectly on some devices due to incompatibility with advanced features.

---

### *Installation*

> [!TIP]
> 1. Download the latest version from the releases tab  
> 2. Flash using Magisk  
> 3. Enjoy your fast device with advanced Galaxy AI!

### *LICENSE*

Licensed under the Project Apex Proprietary License.
See [LICENSE](https://github.com/Llucs/project_apex/blob/main/LICENSE) file for details.

(If you're wondering why the license isn't open source, the reason is that it includes apps and parts of the S25+ firmware, which are owned by Samsung, and since they're not mine, I can't make the project open source.)
