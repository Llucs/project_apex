# Project Apex

Galaxy AI is here - Adds advanced Galaxy AI from S-series devices and performs advanced optimization

### Overview

Project Apex is a Magisk module inspired by Aionix that adds advanced Galaxy AI from high-end S-series devices and performs advanced optimizations specifically for One UI, the same optimizations as "OneUI Enhancer"

Project Apex doesn't perform aggressive optimizations; it performs stable and reversible optimizations that improve your phone's fluidity without compromising stability.

This module also enhances the camera using AI, and since the phone pretends to be an S25+, several things are unlocked, such as apps in the Galaxy Store that were previously unavailable.

### Compatibility

Project Apex is compatible with Samsung devices running One UI 7, but may not function perfectly on some devices due to incompatibility with advanced features.

### Installation

1. Download the latest version from the releases tab

2. Flash using Magisk

3. Enjoy your fast device with advanced Galaxy AI!

### Credits

Credit goes to developer Ali for allowing us to use his Aionix module as a base for Project Apex, and to me, Llucs, for creating Project Apex.

### Known bugs

• Bixby doesn't listen to your voice; you can only chat via text within the app

• The AOD is a bit buggy, with automatic brightness enabled for some reason and sometimes elements of the AOD shifting slightly to the side

See (LICENSE)[https://github.com/Llucs/project_apex/blob/main/LICENSE] file for details.

(If you're wondering why the license isn't open source, the reason is that it includes apps and parts of the S25+ firmware, which are owned by Samsung, and since they're not mine, I can't make the project open source.)
